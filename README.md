# Building AI Assisting FRIDAY isually Impaired Individuals

## **Overview**
Visually impaired individuals often face challenges in understanding their surroundings. Our project aims to address this by providing:

1. 🔍 Real-time scene analysis

2. 🗣️ Text-to-speech conversion

3. 🚧 Object and obstacle detection

4. 🤖 Personalized assistance for tasks
#### 🛠️ Technologies Used: 
* Python: The core programming language for the application.
* Streamlit: A fast and interactive framework for building the user interface.
* YOLOv8: Advanced object detection model for identifying and annotating objects in images.
* Google Generative AI (Gemini 1.5 Pro): Generates human-like scene descriptions and task guidance.
* Tesseract OCR: Extracts text from images for accessibility.
* Pyttsx3: Converts extracted text to speech for seamless auditory feedback.
* OpenCV & PIL: Image processing librarie
